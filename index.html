          <h2>Book Finder App</h2>
          <p>
            Book Finder App is a React-based application that allows users to
            search for books by title, or author using the Google Books API. It
            features a clean UI with dynamic search results, detailed book
            modals, and accessibility enhancements like screen reader support.
            Users can view book thumbnails, descriptions, and direct purchase
            links via Amazon affiliate integration. The app uses lazy loading
            and Suspense to optimize performance and loading times. Favorites
            can be saved locally, with instant visual feedback and animations.
            Responsive design ensures usability across desktop and mobile
            devices. Search suggestions help refine queries based on user input.
            Built with React, Vite, React Router, and custom hooks for
            modularity and maintainability.

          <h2>Product Landing Page – HTML & CSS Learning Project</h2>
          <p>
            This landing page project was built as part of the freeCodeCamp
            Responsive Web Design Certification, which I successfully completed.
            The page showcases three electric guitars (Ibanez, Gibson, and
            Squier) and includes internal navigation, embedded video content,
            responsive layout, and a mock newsletter form. The goal of the
            project was to practice semantic HTML, layout with CSS, image
            handling, anchor navigation, and accessibility basics — all without
            using JavaScript. It served as a great introduction to building
            structured, responsive web pages from scratch.

          <h2>Weather App</h2>
          <p>
            This Weather App allows users to search for real-time weather
            conditions in any city worldwide. It fetches weather data using the
            WeatherAPI and integrates a location autocomplete feature powered by
            OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API. The app displays temperature, wind
            speed, humidity, conditions icon, and the local date, with
            interactive toggles to switch between °C/°F and km/h/mph. It
            features a responsive, grid-based layout styled with CSS animations
            and icons from Font Awesome, all wrapped in a clean and visually
            appealing UI.
